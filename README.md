# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is **diabetic or non-diabetic** using Machine Learning.  
The model is trained on the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset** and implemented using **Python in Google Colab**.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The system analyzes medical attributes such as glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, and other health indicators to predict diabetes.  
A **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier is used to build the prediction model.
